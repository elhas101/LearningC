Differences between C and C++ structs

In C++ structs have a typedef defined automatically, so there is no need to typedef the structures. 

Function overloading allows the same name to be used for different types

Variables passed by reference are passed using & instead of *. 

The default constructor zeroes all the values at the initial declaration. 

& directs to the original value in memory like passing by reference in c 

cout replaces fprint and puts
